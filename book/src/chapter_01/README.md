# Introduction

Velvet is a molecular dynamics simulator created as an exercise to further my understanding of atomistic simulation techniques. 
This guide is intended to exhibit Velvet's features in the context of the relevant theory. 
To achieve this, each section interweaves three perspectives:

1) Physical and mathematical models or theories used to describe the topic.
2) Concrete implementations of the concepts taken from source code.
3) Practical examples using application level abstractions.

Velvet is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and is available as either a command line application or an extensible software library. 
The library documentation is available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/velvet).
