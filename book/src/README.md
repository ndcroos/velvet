# Velvet

Velvet is a molecular dynamics simulator created as an exercise to sharpen my Rust skills and further my understanding of molecular dynamics. Attaining the performance and scope of established tools such as [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/) is not a goal.

This guide serves as high-level documentation describing the features of Velvet and how to use them. Velvet is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and packaged as both a library and a CLI. Code snippets are present in the guide to help developers use the library in other Rust projects, but no knowledge of Rust is required to use the CLI. Complete documentation of the library is available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/velvet).
