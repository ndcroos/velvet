Velvet is a classical atomistic simulation engine with a focus on user-friendliness and extensibility - two features that I believe are not well represented in the current scientific software environment. Velvet offers a powerful plugin system which allows users to extend the engine with custom behavior from their own Rust modules. Plugin authors may publish their extensions to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) or maintain their own private libraries.
