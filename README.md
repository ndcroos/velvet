Velvet is a classical atomistic simulation engine with a focus on user-friendliness and portability - two features that I believe are not well represented in the current scientific software environment. This project is largely a learning exercise, but as development continues I hope to accomplish the following goals:

* Extensibility via user-defined plugin modules
* Optimized single CPU performace with multithreading and SIMD support
* Implement a wide variety of interatomic potentials
* Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo, and Minimization routines
* Visualization tools to analyze simulation results
